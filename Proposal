Description:
The purposes of this exercise is to broaden my horizons in my study of data sciences by focusing on areas that
I have not yet attempted, while applying the underlying pricples that I have studied in the past.  I will be exploring the predictive 
capabilities of several methods in order to determine the future value of the cryptocurrency Etherium.  For this exercise I will force
myself to explore using Python, where the majority of my study has been spent using R.  I would like to attempt constructing an UI that
will make it easy to interact and decipher results, while providing a means to run different scenarios given the models that are in place.

Presentation:
I will use a MongoDb database to store data that is retrieved from an api hosted by the site cryptocompare.com and build an application
layer on top that calls on python to interpret the market.  This application layer will most likley be in an html format.  In my experience,
I have used the Shiny package in R to present my results.  For the sake of learning, I have explored a few libraries that are simillar 
in Python, such as the Dash library (https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/introducing-dash-5ecf7191b503).  I will take advantage of these to 
apply the same foundations that I have in a new way.
